## PCLVisualizer
The code for this demo/tutorial can be found on 
http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcl_visualizer.php.

Unfortunatly, this doesn't compile for me...

We should probably use Daniel Merget's standard viewer or one of the tools
from the PCL package, like for example the `pcl_cloud_composer` or the 
`pcl_point_cloud_editor`.
